## How to integrate with SSV

SSV is a permissionless network that enables the distribution of validator operations between non-trusting operators.

The [SSV Network smart contract](smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md) allows anyone to integrate with the SSV protocol.&#x20;

You also have sources of information such as the [Subgraph](tools/ssv-subgraph/) for data generated by the smart contract, and the [SSV API](https://api.ssv.network/documentation/#/v4) for things like operator metadata.&#x20;

The best way to get started with SSV is using the [SDK](ssv-sdk/), which allows developers to perform transactions to the smart contract, and access Subgraph data, via simple, high level functions.

## Tools and Resources

### [SSV SDK](get-started.md#ssv-sdk)

A comprehensive, open-source developer toolkit that can be used to programatically write scripts for tasks such as [operator management](ssv-sdk/module-reference/operator-module.md), [keyshare generation](tools/ssv-dkg-client/generate-key-shares.md), and [bulk validator registration.](ssv-sdk/examples/bulk-register-validators.md)&#x20;

### [Smart Contracts](smart-contracts/)

The SSV Network and SSV Read contract handle all of the on-chain data regarding SSV.

### [DKG Client](tools/ssv-dkg-client/)

Securely generate keyshares for a validator and distribute them to operators without the full key ever being stored.

### [Subgraph](tools/ssv-subgraph/)

All data about the SSV Network is stored here, accessible through straightforward and user-friendly API calls.

### [SSV API](https://api.ssv.network/documentation/#/v4)&#x20;

A set of calls to get information about the SSV network.

## Validator Registration Overview <a href="#id-7f2y4pcm8bfl" id="id-7f2y4pcm8bfl"></a>

Validators are managed within Clusters - the group of operators that were selected to operate them.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must have a validator key to carry out this process, they can be generated programatically by [as shown in this example](ssv-sdk/examples/create-validator-keys.md).

**Multiple validators can be registered in a single transaction.**
{% endhint %}

Running a distributed validator is a process composed of these steps (outlined in the above schema):

1. Select the cluster of operators to manage your validator.
2. Split your validator key to shares.
3. Retrieve your clusterâ€™s latest snapshot data.
4. Register your validator to the SSV network.

The SSV SDK facilitates all these operations and allows to accomplish them programmatically, as [seen in this example](ssv-sdk/examples/bulk-register-validators.md).
