# Cluster Scanner

The Cluster Scanner tool enables users to retrieve cluster snapshots from the ssv.network [contracts](../../smart-contracts/).

Clusters are unique to each account and are defined by the combination of the validatorâ€™s **owner address** and **operator ids** which were selected to manage it during registration.

Cluster snapshots are required for SSV smart contract transactions with cluster related functions which require the **cluster object** as input:

* [registerValidator()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md#public-registervalidator-publickey-operatorids-shares-amount-cluster)
* [removeValidator()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md#public-removevalidator-publickey-operatorids-cluster)
* [deposit()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md#public-deposit-owner-operatorids-amount-cluster)
* [withdraw()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md#public-withdraw-operatorids-amount-cluster)
* [getBalance()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetworkviews.md#public-getbalance-owner-operatorids-cluster)
* [reactive()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md#public-reactivate-operatorids-amount-cluster)
* [isLiquidated()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetworkviews.md#public-isliquidatable-owner-operatorids-cluster)
* [isLiquidatable()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetworkviews.md#public-isliquidatable-owner-operatorids-cluster)
* [liquidate()](../../smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md#public-liquidate-owner-operatorids-cluster)

Cluster snapshots are updated after each transaction with a cluster related function, and will emit a new **cluster object** (the **latest snapshot)** which will be required for making the succeeding transaction.

The Cluster Scanner tool returns only the **latest snapshot** for a provided cluster.&#x20;

Please note that alternatively, instead of using this tool, you could save the **cluster object** emitted in the event after each transaction, and use it as the input for the succeeding cluster related contract transaction.\
