```
{% endcode %}

When this error appears, it means that the `ssv-dkg` tool cannot connect to one of the selected operators.

This could be temporary, but if it persists, we recommend changing one of the operators.

```
{% endcode %}

When this error appears, it means that the endpoint information for one of the operators is incorrect.

You could manually verify the `operators_info.json` or the initiator command generated by the webapp, or simply change one of the operators.

2023-10-13T15:21:54.597429Z     FATAL   dkg-initiator   ðŸ˜¥ Failed to initiate DKG ceremony:     {"error": "Post \"http://80.181.85.114:3030/init\": dial tcp 80.181.85.114:3030: connect: connection refused"}
```
{% endcode %}

When this error appears, it means that the `ssv-dkg` tool cannot connect to one of the selected operators, and the reason could be because their `ssv-dkg` operator node has shut down.

This could be temporary, as they will likely start the node again, but if it persists, we recommend changing one of the operators.

```
{% endcode %}

This error appears when the `operatorsInfo` argument has been used in conjunction with the `operatorsInfoPath`. These options are mutually exclusive, so please remove one or the other from your YAML config file, or from the command used to launch the initiator.
