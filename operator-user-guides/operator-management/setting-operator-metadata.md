In the following screen, fill-in the form with the information you want to edit.

When you are done, click the _Update_ button, the WebApp will ask you to provide a signature of a message.

Make sure to open your Web3 wallet, if it does not automatically and confirm the transaction.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is not a transaction and will not cost any gas, it's only needed to verify that you are the Operator owner.
{% endhint %}

When the message is successfully signed, the Operator metadata will have been correctly updated.
