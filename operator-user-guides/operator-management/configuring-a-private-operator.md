# Configuring a private Operator

For the moment, the WebApp does not allow to restrict the addresses who can choose an Operator for their Validator Cluster.

The only way to do this is through the `setOperatorWhitelist` function of the `SSVNetwork` smart contract. Please refer to the [smart contract's documentation page for details](../../developers/smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md#setoperatorwhitelist-operatorid-whitelisted).
