# Security Overview

## Introduction
Within Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), validators are operated in clusters of independent operators. Each operator holds a key share rather than the full validator key. For each validator duty, the cluster reaches consensus on what to sign and then a threshold of operators produces partial signatures that are aggregated into a valid BLS signature; the validator’s private key is never reconstructed at any point. 

### How it works
- The validator’s private key is split into ***n* key shares** using [Shamir Secret Sharing](/learn/tech-overview) (SSS) with a chosen threshold *t* (e.g., 3-of-4, 5-of-7).
- Each share is encrypted to the corresponding operator’s public key. So only that operator can recover its own share, because only the operator's private key can decrypt it.
- The resulting output contains the encrypted key shares along with the metadata required for registration on the SSV network.

### Security properties
- **Fault tolerance and uptime:** As long as ***t* of *n*** operators are online and honest, the validator continues to perform duties. A common safety rule is ***n* ≥ 3f + 1**, meaning 7 operators can tolerate 2 faults (→ 5-of-7 threshold).
- **No single point of failure:** No operator has access to the full key. Compromising fewer than *t* shares is useless.
- **Active-active redundancy without slashing:** Multiple diverse operators can co-operate on the same validator safely. Unlike naive failover, DVT’s threshold-signature flow avoids double-signing.
:::note DISCLAIMER
SSV is non-custodial and only uses the validator's validation key, and **never its withdrawal key**. When a “Private key” or “Validator key” is mentioned - it references Validation key specifically.
