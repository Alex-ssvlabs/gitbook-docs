# Operator Concepts

To join the network as an operator a user must run an SSV node. This is software containing the SSV protocol implementation and integration to the network's smart contracts.

This can be done by installing the [node software](/operators/operator-node/) on a machine followed by registering the operator either through the [smart contract](/developers/smart-contracts/ssvnetwork#registeroperatorpublickey-operatorfee-setprivate) or [webapp](https://app.ssv.network/) interface.

### Read more about Operators

- [Verified Operators](./verified-operators.md)
- [Permissions Operators](./permissioned-operators.md)
- [Operator Offboarding](./offboarding.md)
- [Operator Performance](../performance/README.md)

**We also strongly recommend to check out [Cluster Concepts](../clusters/README.md)**, since an operator on SSV Network can only participate as a part of a cluster.
