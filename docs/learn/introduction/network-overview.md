# Network Overview

The ssv.network ecosystem is composed of 3 types of actors: stakers, operators and DAO members.

### [Stakers](../../stakers)    

Services or individual ETH holders that leverage SSV/DVT technology for optimal liveness, security, and decentralization of their validator(s). Stakers pay a fee in SSV tokens to operators for managing their validator(s).

### [Operators](../../operators)

Operators provide the hardware infrastructure, run the SSV protocol, and are responsible for maintaining validators and the overall health of ssv.network. Operators determine their fees for services in SSV tokens and charge stakers for operating and maintaining their validator(s).

### DAO

The ssv.network DAO decentralises ownership and governance of the ssv.network protocol and treasury, with SSV being the native token of the network. DAO exercises its mandate by two main mechanisms, executing governance functions and executing snapshot proposals passed by the token holders. For more information read the [governance section](governance.md).
