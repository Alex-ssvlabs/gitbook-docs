# Validator Concepts
Distributed Validators are managed within Clusters - the group of operators that were selected to operate them.

To run a validator through the SSV network, a user must distribute their validator key to their selected cluster and register it to the networkâ€™s smart contract. This can be done via the [Web App](https://app.ssv.network/) interface, through the smart contracts, or [Developer tools](/docs/developers/README.md).
