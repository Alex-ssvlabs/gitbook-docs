# Tokenomics

The ssv.network utilizes its native SSV token to facilitate payments between stakers and SSV node operators to maintain their validators. Operators maintain validators by reaching a consensus with clusters of other operators to perform network duties on the beacon chain, thereby generating Ethereum staking rewards for stakers.

Operators receive SSV payments and generate ETH rewards for stakers. Stakers pay SSV and receive generated ETH rewards in return.
