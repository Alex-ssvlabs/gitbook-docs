# Developers

SSV is a permissionless network that enables the distribution of validator operations between non-trusting operators.

![Get Started](/img/get-started-1.avif)

## How to integrate with SSV

Eager to jump into action? [Quickstart](/developers/quickstart.md) is a great place to start and automate bulk validator registration using our SDK.

If you're new to ssv network, go through [the Learn section](/learn/introduction/) to understand its core concepts first.

The best way to get started with SSV is using [the SDK](/developers/SSV-SDK/), which allows developers to perform transactions to the smart contract, and access Subgraph data, via simple, high level functions. [SSV SDK Module Reference](/developers/SSV-SDK/module-reference/) can help you understand how it is structured. It might also be helpful to look at [several examples](/developers/SSV-SDK/examples/) of how to use the SSV SDK.

[SSV Network smart contract](./smart-contracts/ssvnetwork.md) allows stakers and operators to coordinate in a permissionless way.

On-chain data generated by the smart contract is made available via [Subgraph](./tools/ssv-subgraph/) and the [SSV API](https://api.ssv.network/documentation/#/v4) (for things like operator metadata).

Lastly, you can start experimenting by interacting with [our Hoodi Testnet](/developers/testnet) smart contracts, before interacting with Mainnet ones.


## Tools and Resources

### [SSV SDK](/developers/SSV-SDK/)

A comprehensive, open-source developer toolkit that can be used to programmatically write scripts for tasks such as [operator management](/developers/SSV-SDK/module-reference/operator-module), [keyshare generation](/developers/tools/ssv-dkg-client/generate-key-shares), and [bulk validator registration](/developers/quickstart.md).

### [Smart Contracts](smart-contracts/)

The SSV Network and SSV Read contract handle all of the on-chain data regarding SSV.

### [DKG Client](tools/ssv-dkg-client/)

Securely generate keyshares for a validator and distribute them to operators without the full key ever being stored.

### [Subgraph](tools/ssv-subgraph/)

All data about the SSV Network is stored here, accessible through straightforward and user-friendly API calls.

### [SSV API](https://api.ssv.network/documentation/#/v4)&#x20;

A set of calls to get information about the SSV network.
