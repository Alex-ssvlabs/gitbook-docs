# Tutorials

In this examples section we will provide quick snippets of code to do certain actions, we will not show the imports/setup for each as [this is covered previously](/developers/SSV-SDK/#initialization).

Most of the examples are following full validator flow:

2. [Generate and Validate Keyshares](./generate-and-validate-keyshares.md)
3. [Register Validator(s)](./register-validator.md)
4. [Manage Cluster Balance](./cluster-balance-script.md)
5. [Exit Validator(s)](./exit-validators.md)
