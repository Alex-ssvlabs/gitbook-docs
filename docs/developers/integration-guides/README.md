# Integration Guides

**Check out the dedicated ["How to integrate" section here](/stakers#how-to-integrate-with-ssv)**. The integration flow will suit most of the Staking Services / Pools.

Other specific integration guides:
- [Lido CSM](./lido-csm.md)
- [Native Restaking](./native-restaking.md) (with EigenLayer)

The guides assume you already have high level understanding of how SSV works. If that is not the case - [visit our Learn section](/learn/introduction) first.
