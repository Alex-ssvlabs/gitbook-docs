# API

Two ways to fetch SSV Network's on-chain data is by using [SSV Subgraph](./ssv-subgraph.md) or [SSV RESTful API](./ssv-api.md). 

- [Subgraph](./ssv-subgraph.md) is recommended to be used in automations/scripts, as it is more reliable and highly customizable.
- [SSV API](./ssv-api.md) is recommended for quick tests or manual requests, as its request types are limited to existing ones and the API is not built to withold a lot of requests.
