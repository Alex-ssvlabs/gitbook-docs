# SSV2.0 Based Applications Protocol

SSV2.0 is a revolutionary bootstrapping model that unlocks new opportunities for validators by bootstrapping off-chain services called “based applications” (bApps). SSV 2.0 enables validators to do more and earn more by extending their security to all applications — creating a new asset class: the Validator.

## How to integrate with SSV 2.0

- Developers can [start building a bApp](/based-applications/developers/get-started) to bootstrap security of service. 
- Infrastructure operators can [create a Strategy](/based-applications/user-guides/create-strategy) to secure bApp(s) and earn rewards for that.
- Stakers / Token holders can [delegate validator's balance](/based-applications/user-guides/delegate-validator) and [deposit tokens](/based-applications/user-guides/deposit-to-strategy) to a strategy.

Based Applications is a new concept and it's important to understand to get the most value out of it.
