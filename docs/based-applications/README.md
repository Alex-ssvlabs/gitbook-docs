# SSV2.0 Based Applications Protocol

## Abstract
The Ethereum validator set is one of the largest and most advanced in the blockchain space. With close to 1.1M active validators (~35M ETH) run by thousands of different entities, it represents the core ethos of Ethereum - a credibly neutral settlement layer. Ethereum’s roadmap favors a polylithic approach for resolving technical challenges (scale, transaction ordering, etc) rather than a monolithic one. The term rollup-centric roadmap was coined by Vitalik Buterin in 2020 and adopted by the wider community. In this paper, we suggest a new term, Based Applications(bApps), to describe a method for re-utilizing Ethereum validators for bootstrapping off-chain services. This approach recognizes the unique properties of Ethereum’s validator set as superior to other forms of security, unlocking an infrastructural layer for a wide range of services.

This is a vision for a possible future presented by SSV Labs to the ssv.network community and is subject to DAO approval
