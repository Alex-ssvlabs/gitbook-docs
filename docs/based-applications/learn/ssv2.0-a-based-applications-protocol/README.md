# SSV2.0 - A Based Applications Protocol

SSV 2.0 upgrades will focus on the following:

- The Based-Applications Chain: A dedicated "App-chain" to encompass both existing DVT contract and bApp features.
- Risk Expressive Model: A novel risk-based model for describing how operators opt-in to secure bApps and the relationship between them.
- Ultra-Sound SSV Token Model: A new deflationary model for SSV, including SSV staking and burning.
