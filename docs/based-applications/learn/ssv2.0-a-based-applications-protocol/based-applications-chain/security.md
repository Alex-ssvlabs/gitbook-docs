# Security

Securing the bApps chain can be achieved by developing it as a based application itself. In this model, Ethereum validators—and eventually validators from other networks— can opt to contribute to the app chain's Cost-To-Attack(CtA). Additionally, SSV staking is employed as slashable capital, acting as a robust form of Cost-Of-Corruption (CoC). This dual-layered approach aligns incentives with penalizing malicious or unreliable behavior. Over time, as the app chain integrates validators across networks, this model will scale to provide unparalleled resilience and trustworthiness for users and developers alike.
