# Multi-Chain

A dedicated ‘application chain’ inherently creates a neutral-based chain, which serves as a crucial layer in eliminating chain-specific dependencies. By being solely focused on coordination and integration, this application chain does not favor any particular Layer 1 (L1) blockchain, thus promoting a decentralized and unbiased environment for validators from multiple L1 chains. It avoids the complexities and risks often associated with cross-chain interactions, where different blockchains might have conflicting protocols, governance models, or consensus mechanisms.

The neutrality of the chain ensures that it can interact with a wide range of L1 blockchains without being inherently tied to or dependent on any one of them. This removes the friction that typically arises from direct L1-to-L1 interactions, which can involve cumbersome compatibility issues, differing security models, or governance conflicts. With a dedicated neutral chain, validators can participate without needing to navigate the intricacies of each individual blockchain, making the overall ecosystem more accessible and less prone to fragmentation.

By being lightweight and focused solely on coordination, a neutral bApps chain reduces overhead and simplifies the system. This lightweight nature allows for more efficient operation, as there are fewer dependencies and less complexity in managing multiple blockchains. The chain acts as an abstraction layer that streamlines interactions between different L1 blockchains, allowing them to coexist without the burden of cross-chain compatibility issues. This simplifies the network's architecture, ensuring faster processing times and a more scalable solution for decentralized applications (bApps).

The neutrality of the chain also means it can quickly adapt to new or changing blockchains. As long as an L1 chain can integrate into the coordination framework, it can become part of the system without needing to alter the underlying architecture. This flexibility makes it easier to scale and evolve the network, ensuring that future blockchain advancements or improvements can be seamlessly incorporated without disrupting the ecosystem.
