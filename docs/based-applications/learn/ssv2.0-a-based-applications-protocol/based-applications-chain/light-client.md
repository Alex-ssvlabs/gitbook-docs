# Light Client

The bApps chain can utilize light clients to ensure efficient and streamlined participation, allowing nodes to verify chain state without the need for full data storage or intensive processing power. By leveraging a partially synchronous BFT consensus like CometBFT, the application chain enables rapid finality and easy synchronization, making it ideal for light clients. These lightweight clients can sync quickly and validate blocks effectively, providing a simple yet reliable interface for bApp developers. This approach reduces the barrier to entry for developers to build based applications and the operators running their code.
