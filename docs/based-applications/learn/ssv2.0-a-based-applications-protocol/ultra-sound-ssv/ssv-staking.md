# SSV Staking

For the bApps chain’s security, a new Based Application will be deployed to manage the operator set, securing the chain, collateral requirements, slashing, and rewards. The chain will use the [“Risk expressive Model (REM)”](../risk-expressive-model/) to manage each operator’s voting weight and rewards (according to the number of validators, staked SSV, and obligation ratios) and slashing conditions.
As done with the Ethereum blockchain and others, and in order to guarantee the integrity of the bApps chain, SSV tokens will be staked, exclusively, as a slashable commitment for validators. Misbehaviours will cause penalties in SSV.

Operators can use delegated validator balance and/or SSV from delegators. Operators with more capital are entitled to more tasks and rewards.
