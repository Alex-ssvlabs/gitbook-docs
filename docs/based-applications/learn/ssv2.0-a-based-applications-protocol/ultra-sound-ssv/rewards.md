# Rewards

Fees accumulated will be distributed to each operator based on its obligation to the bApp. Operators can set a percentage of the amount of rewards to be distributed to accounts that delegate validators and/or SSV tokens to them. The remaining part of the rewards are kept by the operators as operator fees.
