# Fees

Participation in DVT staking or based applications will require paying fees in the form of network fees. Currently, SSV charges network fees for running validators on clusters, that is, within the context of fees, a one-dimensional structure. The new fee mechanics will create a three-dimensional fee structure for SSV:


| Category | Fee | Details |
|----------|-----|---------|
| F1 - L1 staking | Fixed per validator | L1 validator network fee, set by DAO to be 1% of Ethereum APR |
| F2 - bApp participation | Per bApp usage | Each bApp "opt-in" requires an additional network fee |
| F3 - Tx Fees | Per congestion | Transactions on the bApp chain require fees from the sender |

*Table 5: new fee structure*


All collected fees from the categories above will either be distributed as rewards to operators or burnt.
