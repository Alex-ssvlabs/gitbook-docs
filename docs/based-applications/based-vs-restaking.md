# Based Applications vs Restaking

Restaking and bApps approach some of the same challenges in different ways. While Restaking relies on capital delegation with slashing risks, bApps also allows the utilization of L1 validators with no slashing conditions.


The different approaches result in different economic, technical, and practical differences.


| | Risk | Cost | Participation model | Scale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Based Applications** | Only on tokens | Low for L1 validators | Infinite-Sum game | All L1 validators can join risk-free |
| **Restaking** | Cascading slashing risk for Ethereum | High for all | Zero-sum game | Bound by L1 validator risk tolerance |
