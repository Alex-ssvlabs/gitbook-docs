# Use Cases

| Category | Use Cases | Description | Validator Set Importance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DeFi** | Oracles, Cross-Chain Bridges, Advanced Financial Protocols. | Utilize validator security to provide reliable pricing, liquidity transfers, and novel financial mechanisms. | Requires strong decentralization and reliability to prevent fraud, ensure data accuracy, and maintain trust. |
| **Data** | Data Availability, storage, Rollups. | Provide guaranteed data availability for Layer 2 rollups and other off-chain data solutions. | A strong validator set ensures reliable data publication, mitigating risks related to data withholding or loss. |
| **Off-Chain Computation** | Co-processors, Ad-hoc execution, Verifiers. | Offload computation and storage to a decentralized network while maintaining verifiability. | Requires trusted validator nodes to ensure computation results and data are correct and verifiable. |
| **Security as a Service** | Fraud Proofs, Slashing Mechanisms, Firewalls, Attack Detection. | Offer additional security services to other blockchain protocols like slashing and fraud detection. | Needs an equally robust validator set to that of Ethereum to uphold network integrity, enforce accountability, and provide effective deterrence against attacks. |
| **Middleware Extensions** | Relayers, Indexers, Event Streaming. | Middleware infrastructure to bridge different blockchain layers or to provide specialized services. | The validator set must be trustworthy to maintain secure cross-layer communication and accurate data indexing. |
| **Governance & Coordination** | DAOs, Collective Voting Systems, Community Funds. | Facilitate decentralized governance and coordination processes in a transparent and trustless manner. | A decentralized validator set is essential to ensure decisions are executed without manipulation or central authority. |
| **Cross-Chain Communication** | Interoperability Layers, Message Passing Protocols. | Enable communication and asset transfer across multiple blockchains | A secure validator set ensures the reliability and trust in communication between distinct blockchain ecosystems. |
| **Economic Security Extensions** | Bonded Validators for Collateralized Systems. | Provide collateral and bonded services for systems requiring economic guarantees. | A validator set as strong as Ethereum ensures economic guarantees, minimizing risk of financial loss due to validator failures. |
| **Validator Commitments** | Pre-Confirmations, Based Sequencers, Transaction Ordering. | Validators provide additional services like pre-confirmation of transactions, sequencing, and ordering to reduce latency and optimize blockchain efficiency. | A robust validator set is essential for pre-confirmations to provide guarantees on finality, while based sequencers ensure fair and predictable transaction ordering to enhance network performance and mitigate risks associated with transaction manipulation. |
