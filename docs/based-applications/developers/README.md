# Developers

Developing a Based Application involves several steps, we prepared [an overview page with a chart](/based-applications/developers/get-started.md) for better understand of the whole process.

We also prepared [a bApp example](/based-applications/developers/bapp-example.md), to demonstrate how the implementation could look like.

The primary tools to build you bApp are [BA SDK](/based-applications/developers/BA-SDK/README.md) and [Smart Contracts](/based-applications/developers/smart-contracts/README.md). Both of the sections should have everything you need to kickstart the bApp development process.

Lastly, you can [incorporate Subgraph queries](/based-applications/developers/subgraph/) into your Based Application, which is a straightforward way to fetch on-chain data programmatically.
