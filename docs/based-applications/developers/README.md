# Introduction to Based Applications


Validators are the backbone of Ethereum, providing essential services to the blockchain. However, apart from performing duties and securing Ethereum, for the first time we show that Ethereum validators can also serve other decentralized systems with their established Sybil resistance and staked capital.


Based Applications(bApps) are a new class of decentralized applications that leverage the Ethereum validator set for enhanced security, bootstrapping, and new capabilities. These applications make use of Ethereum's existing validator set(as opposed to capital) to quickly establish trust and operational resilience without having to build their own validator networks. Examples include based rollups, co-processors, oracles, bridges, and more. Additionally, bApps can serve novel applications like pre-confirmations, where validators can pre-confirm transactions before final inclusion in a block, reducing latency and improving user experience. By utilizing Ethereum's existing validator set, bApps can unlock new possibilities for scalability and user interaction while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.
