# Based Application Development

This guide outlines the steps for based applications developers looking to build on the Based Applications platform.

<!-- ## 0. Developing a Based Application Middleware smart contract

The `BAppManager` smart contract developed by SSV Labs accepts registrations of BApps that implement a specific interface. This is outlined [in this dedicated page](./smart-contracts/based-app-middleware-example.md), that also provides a simple example. -->

## 1. Configuring and Registering the bApp

1. **Define core attributes**:
- `bApp`: a unique 20-byte EVM address that uniquely identifies the bApp.
- `tokens`:  A list of ERC-20 tokens to be used in the bApp's security mechanism. For the native ETH token, use the special address [`0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`](https://github.com/ssvlabs/based-applications/blob/main/src/BasedAppManager.sol#L62).
- `sharedRiskLevels`: a list with $\beta$ values, one for each token, representing the bApp's tolerance for risk (token over-usage).
2. **Optional Non-Slashable Validator Balance**: If the bApp uses non-slashable validator balance, it should be configured off-chain, in the bApp's network.
3. **Register the bApp**: Use the [`registerBApp`](https://github.com/ssvlabs/based-applications/blob/main/src/BasedAppManager.sol#L249) function of the smart contract:
```javascript
function registerBApp(
   address bApp,
   address[] calldata tokens,
   uint32[] calldata sharedRiskLevels,
   string calldata metadataURI
)
```
- `metadataURI`: A JSON object containing additional details about your bApp, such as its name, description, logo, and website.
4. **Update Configuration**: After registering, the bApp configuration can be updated only by the `owner` account.

## 2. Securing the bApp

Once the bApp is registered, `Strategies` can join it and allocate capital to secure it.

### 2.1 Opting in

A Strategy opts-in to the bApp by using the [`optInToBApp`](https://github.com/ssvlabs/based-applications/blob/main/src/BasedAppManager.sol#L333) function of the smart contract:
```javascript
function optInToBApp(
   uint256 strategyId,
   address bApp,
   address[] calldata tokens,
   uint32[] calldata obligationPercentages,
   bytes calldata data
)
```
- `tokens`: List of tokens to obligate to the bApp.
- `obligationPercentages`: The proportion of each token's balance to commit to the bApp.
- `data`: An extra optional field for off-chain information required by the bApp for participation.

For example, if `tokens = [SSV]` and `obligationPercentages = [50%]`, then 50% of the strategy's `SSV` balance will be obligated to the bApp.

The strategyâ€™s owner can later update their obligations by modifying existing ones or adding a new token obligation.

### 2.2 Strategy's Funds

To compose their balances, strategies:
1. receive ERC20 (or ETH) via [**deposits**](https://github.com/ssvlabs/based-applications/blob/main/src/BasedAppManager.sol#L376) from accounts.
2. inherit the non-slashable validator balance from the strategy's owner account. Accounts [**delegate**](https://github.com/ssvlabs/based-applications/blob/main/src/BasedAppManager.sol#L201) validator balances between themselves, and the strategy inherits its owner's non-delegated balance plus the received balances from other accounts.

## 3. Participant Weight

bApp clients need to track the weight of each participant in the bApp. For all the strategies that opted-in to a given bApp, clients will need to:

1. **Gather Obligated Balances**: Get the obligated balance from each strategy, for each token used by the bApp.
   ```go
   ObligatedBalance mapping(Token -> Strategy -> Amount)
   ```
   This is done by multiplying the `percentage` of obligated tokens by the `balance` of such tokens deposited to the strategy

2. **Sum Obligations**: From `ObligatedBalance`, bApps should sum all obligations and compute the total amount obligated to the bApp by all strategies.
   ```go
   TotalBAppBalance mapping(Token -> Amount)
   ```
3. **Calculate Risk**: For each token, it should get the risk (token-over usage) of each strategy. This is obtained by summing all the `percentages` in all `Obligations` for a given token, and dividing it by `100`.
   ```go
   Risk mapping(Token -> Strategy -> Float)
   ```
4. **Compute Risk-Aware Weights**: With this information, bApps can compute the weight of a participant for a certain token by

   $$
   W_{\text{strategy, token}} = c_{\text{token}} \times \dfrac{ObligatedBalance[\text{token}][\text{strategy}]}{TotalBAppBalance[\text{token}]} e^{-\beta_{\text{token}} \times max(1, Risk[\text{token}][\text{strategy}])}
   $$

   where $c_{\text{token}}$ is a normalization constant defined as

   $$
   c_{\text{token}} = \left( \sum_{\text{strategy}} \dfrac{ObligatedBalance[\text{token}][\text{strategy}]}{TotalBAppBalance[\text{token}]} e^{-\beta_{\text{token}} \times max(1, Risk[\text{token}][\text{strategy}])} \right)^{-1}
   $$

5. **If the bApp uses validator balance**, the client should also generate a mapping of `Strategy -> Validator Balance` with the amount from each strategy. Clients will need to do this in a couple of steps:

    a. **Gather Delegated Balances**: Get all the delegations made to the owner of a strategy for all the strategies that opted in to a bApp.

      ```go
      DelegatedBalance mapping(Strategy -> Amount)
      ```
    
      Bear in mind, these are *stored as percentages*. The effective validator balance can be looked up the beacon chain (the [`based-apps-sdk`](https://github.com/ssvlabs/based-apps-sdk) provides a function to do this: `getValidatorsBalance(account)`), and then multiplied by the percentage that is delegated.
      These values need to be summed, in order to obtain the delegated balance for each owner.

    b. **Sum all delegated balances** for all strategies.
      ```go
      TotalBAppDelegatedBalance mapping(Validator Balance -> Amount)
      ```

    d. **Compute Weights**. As this capital doesn't involve any type of risk, all risk values can be set to 0. Thus, for this capital, this is equivalent to:

      $$
      W_{\text{strategy, validator balance}} = \dfrac{ObligatedBalance[\text{validator balance}][\text{strategy}]}{TotalBAppBalance[\text{validator balance}]}
      $$

6. **Combine into the Final Weight**: With the per-token weights, the final step is to compute a final weight for the participant using a **combination function**. Such function is defined by the bApp and can be tailored to its specific needs. Traditional examples include the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean.


**Example**: Let's consider a bApp that uses tokens $A$ and $B$, and considers $A$ to be twice as important as $B$. Then, it could use the following weighted harmonic mean as its combination function:

$$
W^{\text{final}}_{\text{strategy}} = c_{\text{final}} \times \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{2/3}{W_{\text{strategy, A}}} + \dfrac{1/3}{W_{\text{strategy, B}}}}
$$

where $c_{\text{final}}$ is a normalization constant computed as

$$
c_{\text{final}} = \left( \sum_{\text{strategy}} \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{2/3}{W_{\text{strategy, A}}} + \dfrac{1/3}{W_{\text{strategy, B}}}} \right)^{-1}
$$
