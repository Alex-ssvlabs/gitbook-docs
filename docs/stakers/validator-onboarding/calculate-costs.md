# Calculate Costs

SSV Network requires validators to pay annual network fees in $SSV tokens. To successfully register validators, you must pre-fund your cluster to cover:
- **Runway balance** — the funds required to pay validator fees over your chosen period.
- **Liquidation collateral** — an additional 14 days’ worth of fees, kept as a safety buffer.
- Collateral is fully refundable when validators are offboarded.

For detailed explanations, see:
- **SSV Docs: Cluster Balances** ←←←
- [SSV Docs: Liquidations](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/protocol-overview/tokenomics/liquidations/)

## Example Costing Table
| Validators | Annual Fee / Validator | Annual Total | Monthly Runway | Liquidation Collateral | Initial Funding Target |
|------------|------------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1,000      | 3.05 SSV               | 3,050 SSV    | 250.68 SSV     | 250.68 SSV             | 501.37 SSV             |
| 500        | 3.05 SSV               | 1,525 SSV    | 125.34 SSV     | 125.34 SSV             | 250.68 SSV             |


:::info Incentivized Mainnet
DAO incentives may partially be applied to cover network fees. Check the **Incentivized Mainnet Rewards section** ←←← and the [Incentive Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EmsAuwfXtnu_2_y6vjMKrXWpLISzbWL8kZOdJznKEUU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) for additional details
