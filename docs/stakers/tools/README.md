# Tools

:::note 
If you want to automate bulk key shares generation, [**follow this guide**](/developers/) instead of using SSV Keys CLI.
:::

This section describes the technical details about the tools for stakers:
- [SSV Keys CLI](./ssv-keys-cli.md) is used for key share files generation via CLI commands.
- [SSV DKG](./ssv-dkg-client/README.md) is the tool to perform DKG ceremonies.
