### Slashing warning

The warning alerts you of the potential dangers of registering a validator on the SSV network. If the same set of validator keys is also being used by other consensus and validator clients your validators can be slashed.

**Please make sure to stop any other running validator setup**, if you have any. 

### Validator summary

By clicking on Register validator, you'll be proposed to sign transactions to confirm your choice and transfer the SSV balance necessary to cover for the operational costs.

:::info
**Note:** If this is the first time you are registering a validator to ssv.network, you will be required to make two transactions - one to approve the SSV smart contract and another one to register the validator.
