# Quickstart
:::info please note
This page streamlines the onboarding process for staking providers, staking pools, and other services.

 **Solo-Stakers** [**should follow this page**](/stakers/solo-stakers/README.md) which explains the flow that is more tailored to Individual ETH holders.

Stakers on SSV network come in various forms. Yet all of the groups supply the required capital to enable validators on the beacon chain. Capital providers must pay a fee in SSV to their chosen operators for managing their validator(s).

To gain more understanding of how onboarding to SSV works conceptually and technically, check out [SSV Network Overview](/learn/network-overview/) and [Security Overview](/learn/security) pages. 

## How to integrate with SSV

### Prerequisites
- **Infra:** Machines with synced EL + CL clients.
- **Security:** An offline/air‑gapped environment for all private key operations.
- **Access:** Administrative access to your current validator setup; you must be able to shut it down during migration.
- **Wallet:** On‑chain wallet with sufficient $SSV to register validators, cover network fees, and liquidation collateral.

:::info Testnet Dry Run
Before proceeding on Mainnet, we recommend to perform the entire migration flow on the SSV Testnet (Hoodi). This ensures that your infrastructure, processes, and key handling are validated in a safe environment.

### Setup Operators
Setting up your SSV operators correctly ensures they can participate in the distributed key protocol without delays. You will find detailed step-by-step instructions in the linked guides:
1. **Deploy SSV Nodes**

You have to deploy multiple SSV nodes to form a cluster — repeat the full setup once per every node. Possible number of nodes in a cluster are 4, 7, 10, and 13.

*Recommended:* [SSV-Stack for a fast, easy installation](/operators/operator-node/node-setup#process-overview). On first start, it generates a random password and private key files.   
*Alternative:* manual install [following the official guide](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/manual-setup).

2. **Configure Monitoring**

*Recommended:* SSV-Stack provisions monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) by default. Access it by http://localhost:3000. You can [find more details here](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-stack/blob/main/README.md).   
*Alternative:* For manual setup, we assume you know how to deploy Grafana and Prometheus. Our official Grafana dashboard JSON can be [downloaded here](/operators/operator-node/monitoring/dashboard-runbook).

3. **Configure MEV**

MEV settings are primarily on the consensus client. Follow your CL’s MEV guide [alongside SSV’s MEV guide](/operators/operator-node/setup-sidecars/configuring-mev).

4. **Register Operators**

[Repeat this Operator Registration flow](/operators/operator-management/registration) once per every node you deployed. Use the public keys derived from each node’s generated private key files.
- Set operator fee.
- Set operator metadata.
- Description and logo for your entity.

If you want to have a private cluster:
- Set private permissions.
- Mark all operators as private.
- Whitelist the wallet address you’ll use for validator onboarding.

5. **Backup Operator Secrets**

[Securely back up](/operators/operator-node/maintenance/node-migration#node-backup) operator key and password files.
:::warning Critical
Losing either file will permanently disable the related operator. If enough operators in a cluster are lost, validators will be offline which will require to repeat the migration process.
:::

6. **Ongoing Maintenance**

[Keep nodes current](/operators/operator-node/maintenance/troubleshooting#faq) with new SSV releases.
If you encounter issues, consult the [Troubleshooting guide](/operators/operator-node/maintenance/troubleshooting) or reach out to our team.

### Validator Onboarding

With everything in place, you can start migrating validators to your operators. Follow [Validator Onboarding section](/stakers/validator-onboarding/) to ensure a smooth process.
