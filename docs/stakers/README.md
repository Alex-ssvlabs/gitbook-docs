# Stakers

Stakers using the ssv network come in various forms: staking services/providers, staking pools, or individual ETH holders that supply the initially required capital to enable validators on the beacon chain. To enable the operation of a distributed validator, stakers must pay a fee in SSV to their chosen operators for them to manage their validator(s).

Users that leverage the SSV networkâ€™s DVT technology will promote optimal liveness, security, and decentralization for their validator(s).

## How to integrate with SSV

If you already have the keystore for your validator, jump into action and register it to ssv network with [Quickstart page](/docs/stakers/quickstart.md).

If you'd like to start by understanding how Distributed Validators work on ssv network, check out the [Validator Onboarding page](/stakers/validators/validator-onboarding/).

Validators are distributed to several operators, forming a cluster. Each cluster has its balance to pay for network and operator fees, so you might want to [learn about cluster balance](/stakers/clusters/cluster-balance) and its caveats.

Practically speaking, there are several ways to interact with a cluster. For example, [adding more SSV to cluster's balance](/stakers/cluster-management/depositing-ssv/), [adding more validators](/stakers/cluster-management/adding-validator-to-existing-cluster), and other actions listed on [the Cluster Management section](/stakers/cluster-management).

Finally, there is an option to automate the onboarding through a script, if you manage a large number of validators. [Check out the example](/docs/developers/quickstart.md) of how to do it using our SDK is the starting place.

We suggest to skim through all of the guides on our documentation, to get familiar with all of the concepts and possible actions. If you still have questions, feel free to ask them on the [official Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/ssvnetworkofficial).
