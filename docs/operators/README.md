# Operators

Operators provide hardware infrastructure, run the SSV protocol, and are responsible for maintaining the overall health of ssv.network. Operators determine their own fees and are compensated for their integral services to the network by operating and maintaining validators on-behalf of stakers.

**Short overview of this section:**
1. [**Operator Onboarding**](./operator-onboarding/) - understand what operator is, what are the fees, and so on.
2. [**Running a Node**](./operator-node/) - setup, run, and maintain your SSV Node.
3. [**Operator Management**](./operator-management/) - register as operator in the network, managing fees, etc.
