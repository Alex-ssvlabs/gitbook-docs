# Operators

Operators provide hardware infrastructure, run the SSV protocol (SSV Node), and are responsible for maintaining the overall health of ssv.network. Operators determine their own fees and are compensated for their integral services to the network by operating and maintaining validators on-behalf of stakers.

## How to participate in SSV

On a high level, starting as an Operator means [setting up an SSV Node](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/README.md) and [Registering a new Operator on the network](/operators/operator-management/registration.md).

However, it's beneficial to start by learning [how Operator Fees work](/operators/operator-onboarding/) and [how they are updated](/operators/operator-onboarding/update-fee), to understand how you will be rewarded for your work.

Also, since the Node setup is highly technical, we tried to simplify this process with [Hardware Requirements](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/hardware-requirements) and [Best Practices](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/best-practices) pages.

Apart from essentials, you may benefit from [setting up a DKG node](/operators/operator-node/setup-sidecars/enabling-dkg/) and [enabling MEV](/operators/operator-node/setup-sidecars/configuring-mev). That will attract more Stakers to onboard validators to your Operator. Don't forget to reflect both changes [on your Operator metadata](/operators/operator-management/setting-operator-metadata).

Last but not least, use our [Grafana dashboard](/operators/operator-node/monitoring/dashboard-runbook) to monitor your node in real time, and check out the [Troubleshooting section](/operators/operator-node/maintenance/troubleshooting) to get to the root of any issue you might have with your node.

We suggest to skim through all of the guides on our documentation, to get familiar with all of the concepts and possible actions. If you still have questions, feel free to ask them on the [official Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/ssvnetworkofficial).
