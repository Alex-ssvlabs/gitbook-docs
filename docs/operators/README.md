# Operators

Operators provide hardware infrastructure, run the SSV protocol software (SSV Node), and are responsible for maintaining the overall health of ssv.network. 

Operators determine their own fees and are compensated for their integral services to the network by operating and maintaining validators on-behalf of stakers.

![Operators receive SSV payments and generate ETH rewards for stakers. Stakers pay SSV and receive generated ETH rewards in return.](/img/tokenomics-readme-1.avif)

## How to participate in SSV

- Learn [how Operator Fees work](/operators/operator-onboarding/) and [how they are updated](/operators/operator-onboarding/update-fee).

- [Set up an SSV Node](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/README.md) and [Register a new Operator on the network](/operators/operator-management/registration.md).

- Check out [Hardware Requirements](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/hardware-requirements) and [Best Practices](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/best-practices) to ensure the best performance.

- Additionally, [setting up sidecars](/operators/operator-node/setup-sidecars/) can attract more Stakers to your Operator. Don't forget to reflect changes [on your Operator metadata](/operators/operator-management/setting-operator-metadata).

- If you're having issues, use our [Grafana dashboard](/operators/operator-node/monitoring/dashboard-runbook) and check out the [Troubleshooting section](/operators/operator-node/maintenance/troubleshooting).

We suggest to skim through all of the guides on our documentation, to get familiar with all of the concepts and possible actions. If you still have questions, feel free to ask them on the [official Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5vT22pRBrf).
