# Running a Node

This section is to help you install and run your SSV Node ðŸš€

The steps to follow on your journey:
1. [**Install SSV Node**](./node-setup)
    * [Hardware Requirements](./node-setup/hardware-requirements.md) - to make sure your hardware is sufficient.
    * [*Node Configuration Reference*](./node-setup/node-configuration-reference.md) - (*optional*) reference of SSV's node config.
    * [*Manual Node Setup*](./node-setup/manual-setup.md) - (*optional*) alternative setup guide with manual installation.
2. [**Install Sidecars**](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/enabling-dkg/)
    * [Enable DKG](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/enabling-dkg/) - to participate in DKG ceremonies and get more validators.
    * [Configure MEV](/operators/operator-node/node-setup/configuring-mev) - to increase rewards for block proposals.
    * [Configure Primev](./node-setup/configuring-primev.md) - alternative to MEV, includes Pre-confirmations.
3. [**Monitoring setup**](./monitoring/README.md)
    * [Dashboard Runbook](./monitoring/dashboard-runbook.md) - install our Grafana dashboard and learn how to use it.
    * [*Metrics Index*](./monitoring/metrics-index.md) - (*optional*) learn about SSV metrics in detail.
4. [**Maintenance**](./maintenance/README.md)
    * [Troubleshooting](./maintenance/troubleshooting.md) - identify and fix issues with your setup.
    * [Common Errors](./maintenance/common-errors.md) - learn about most common errors you might see in your logs.
    * [*Node Migration*](./maintenance/node-migration.md) - (*optional*) guide on how to migrate an SSV Node.
    * [*DKG Node Migration*](./maintenance/dkg-operator-migration.md) - (*optional*) guide on how to migrate DKG Node.

After you're done with installation, you can go and [register your operator](../operator-management/README.md) to the network.
