# Enabling DKG

The `ssv-dkg` tool enables operators to participate in ceremonies to generate distributed validator keys for Ethereum stakers.

The `ssv-dkg` tool is separate from the `ssv-node`, and could be running on a different machine, but the two are heavily correlated, as the keyshare generated by the `ssv-dkg` tool, will ultimately be used by the Node itself to manage the related validator.

:::warning
If you wish to take part in DKG ceremonies initiated by stakers and increase your opportunity to run their validators, **it is crucial to have your ssv-dkg client online at all times**.

Also, in order to access logs it is necessary to utilize permanent storage when running this software.

You can setup your `ssv-dkg` node by following these three pages:

1. [**Prerequisites**](prerequisites.md)&#x20;
2. [**Start DKG Node**](start-dkg-node/)&#x20;
3. [**Final Steps**](final-steps.md)
