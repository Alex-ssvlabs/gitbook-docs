# Setting fee recipient address

### Connect your Web3 wallet to WebApp.

The default setting for all validators in a given account is to send execution layer rewards to the owner address. This page explains how to change this.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This procedure will set the fee recipient address for block proposal rewards **for all your validators**.
{% endhint %}

For more information on this topic, please refer to [the dedicated learning page](../../learn/stakers/validators/validator-rewards.md).

Make sure to connect your Web3 wallet with the WebApp, and that the address corresponds with the one you want to manage your Validators with.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Your account is associated with your Web3 wallet.
{% endhint %}

In the Validator Clusters dashboard under My Account page, click on the Fee Address button:

Enter the address of the wallet you want to receive rewards for all your validators, then click on Update:

Confirm and sign the transaction from your Web3 wallet (Metamask in the example):

Once the transaction has been signed and confirmed by the network, the fee recipient address for block proposal rewards will be correctly set for all your validators.
