# SSV Documentation Repository

## ðŸ“– Overview

SSV (Secret Shared Validators) is a decentralized infrastructure that enables secure, fault-tolerant, and non-custodial staking on Ethereum. This documentation aims to provide:

- **Getting Started Guides** for developers, stakers, and operators.
- **Technical Documentation** covering the SSV protocol, SDK, and Based Applications.
- **Deployment Instructions** for setting up an SSV validator or operator.
- **FAQ and Troubleshooting** to assist users in resolving common issues.

## ðŸš€ Running the Documentation Locally

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator optimized for technical documentation.
