The ssv.network utilizes its native SSV token to facilitate payments between stakers and SSV node operators to maintain their validators. Operators maintain validators by reaching a consensus with clusters of other operators to perform network duties on the beacon chain, thereby generating Ethereum staking rewards for stakers.
