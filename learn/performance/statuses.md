# Statuses

The status of network participants serves as a monitoring metric for the activity and functionality of the network members.

![Operator Statuses](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fZ618LngFTb5qTwYjgM6L1Kpg-A\_gKXDYcohVLarLVF\_AsP5C7TKBjC3-yw1Np4hVoLSAO\_QoI1L3mBR56eiHpfmA3WnVdoAmmKSbrezo\_yPCtxL10T-akiJNlYzJX\_FGHNqYks7mr1DiBCf1Q)

The status, which can be either **‘active’** or **‘inactive,’** is derived from the operator’s attendance of duties and refers to their status within the ssv network, not **the beacon chain.**

All participants are regarded as “active” unless the cases below apply:

* **Validator** - its operators carried out no duties in the last 2 epochs.
* **Operator** - has not carried out any duties for the previous 2 epochs for the majority of his validators.
