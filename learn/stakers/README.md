# Stakers

Stakers using the ssv network come in various forms: staking services/providers, staking pools, or individual ETH holders that supply the initially required capital to enable validators on the beacon chain. To enable the operation of a distributed validator, stakers must pay a fee in SSV to their chosen operators for them to manage their validator(s).

Users that leverage the SSV networkâ€™s DVT technology will promote optimal liveness, security, and decentralization for their validator(s)
